# TCP-UDP Server and Client Connection in Python

This project provides example code for implementing TCP/UDP server and client connections in Python.


## Requirements

To run this code, you will need:

    Python 3.x
    A terminal window or command prompt

## Usage

    1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    
    2. Navigate to the repository directory in a terminal window or command prompt.
    
    3. To run the TCP server code, execute the following command: python tcp_server.py
    
    4. In a separate terminal window or command prompt, navigate to the repository directory and run the TCP client code with this command: python tcp_client.py
    
    5. To run the UDP server code, execute the following command: python udp_server.py
    
    6. In a separate terminal window or command prompt, navigate to the repository directory and run the UDP client code with this command: python udp_client.py

The TCP and UDP client programs will send a message to their respective servers, and the servers will send the same message back to the clients. The clients will print the received message, and both the client and server will close the connection.
